### Definition
Reprogrammable machine
## Types of robots considered
- open kinematic chain (hinge)
	- revolves around a single axis
- using either revolute or prismatic joints (linear)
	- extending and retracting
## Basic terminology
- Configuration space (C-Space) 
	- Current position of the robot
- Workspace
	- Reachable workspace - all points reachable
	- Dexterous workspace - all points reachable with any orientation
- Degrees-of-freedom
	- DoF of robot regarding its independent movable joints
	- DoF reg. A robot's reachable workspace (minimal DoF number)
		- More joint DoF than workspace DoF: Kinematic redundant manipulator
